# Media Directory

This directory holds all video, audio, and image assets for the retro TV system.
Large media files are excluded from git — only essential images are tracked.

## Expected Structure

## Adding Content

1. Place video files (`.mp4`, `.mkv`) in the appropriate genre or channel directory
2. Run `bin/generate_index.sh <directory>` to rebuild the file index for a channel
3. Or run `bin/rebuild_indexes.sh` to rebuild all indexes at once
4. Channel directories referenced in `config/schedule_config.json` must exist here
